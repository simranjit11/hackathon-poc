# Story 1.5: MCP Read Tools (Balance, Transactions, Loans)

**Status:** Completed
**Priority:** 🔥 **HIGH PRIORITY** (Core Data Pipeline)

---

## Story

**As a** banking customer  
**I want to** retrieve my account information via voice commands  
**So that** I can check balances, view transactions, and inquire about loans

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. MCP FastAPI server exposes read-only banking tools
2. Tools require JWT authentication with read scope
3. Balance lookup tool returns account balances for all account types
4. Transaction history tool returns recent transactions with filtering
5. Loan information tool returns loan details and payment schedules
6. All results are masked before returning to orchestrator
7. Results are cached appropriately (balances: 5min, transactions: 2min)
8. Tool execution is logged with masked payloads for audit

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- JWT generation is already implemented in orchestrator (Story 1.1)
- Tool call validation is handled by LLM handler (Story 1.4)

### Architecture References
[Source: docs/architecture.md#component-architecture]

**MCP FastAPI Server:**
- Exposes hardened, JWT-authenticated banking tools
- Emits elicitation pauses when user validation is required
- Endpoints: `/mcp/balance`, `/mcp/transactions`, `/mcp/loans`

**JWT Authentication:**
- Short-lived JWTs (5-15 minutes)
- Scopes: `read`, `transact`, `configure`
- MCP validates JWT before execution

**Caching Strategy:**
- Balance results: 5 minutes TTL
- Transaction results: 2 minutes TTL
- Loan results: 10 minutes TTL

**Data Masking:**
- Account numbers: `****1234`
- Sensitive merchant information masked
- All logs use masked data only

### Existing Codebase Context

**Current Implementation:**
- No MCP server exists yet
- Agent has mock data in `agent.py` with function tools
- Need to create separate MCP FastAPI server

**Files to Create:**
- `mcp-server/` - New directory for MCP server
- `mcp-server/main.py` - FastAPI application
- `mcp-server/auth.py` - JWT validation
- `mcp-server/tools/balance.py` - Balance tool
- `mcp-server/tools/transactions.py` - Transactions tool
- `mcp-server/tools/loans.py` - Loans tool

**Files to Modify:**
- `livekit-voice-agent/mcp_client.py` - Create MCP client

### File Locations

**MCP Server (New Service):**
- `mcp-server/main.py` - FastAPI application entry point
- `mcp-server/auth.py` - JWT authentication middleware
- `mcp-server/tools/balance.py` - Balance lookup tool
- `mcp-server/tools/transactions.py` - Transaction history tool
- `mcp-server/tools/loans.py` - Loan information tool
- `mcp-server/config.py` - Configuration
- `mcp-server/models.py` - Data models

**Backend (Orchestrator):**
- `livekit-voice-agent/mcp_client.py` - New file for MCP client

### Dependencies

**MCP Server:**
- `fastapi` - Web framework
- `python-jose` - JWT handling
- `httpx` - HTTP client for banking API
- `redis` - Caching (optional, can use in-memory)

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests:**
- Test JWT validation
- Test each tool endpoint
- Test data masking
- Test caching logic

**Integration Tests:**
- Test full flow: Orchestrator → MCP → Banking API
- Test authentication flow
- Test error handling

**E2E Tests:**
- Test balance inquiry end-to-end
- Test transaction history end-to-end
- Test loan inquiry end-to-end
